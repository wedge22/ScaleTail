ScaleTail provides ready-to-run [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) stacks that instantly connect your self-hosted applications to your [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/docs/concepts/tailnet). By using a sidecar configuration, your applications get an [URL](https://grokipedia.com/page/URL) with automatic [HTTPS](https://grokipedia.com/page/HTTPS), for example: `https://application.tail-net.ts.net`.

## Tailscale Information

### Tailscale Funnel vs. Tailscale Serve

Tailscale Funnel securely exposes services to the public internet. Tailscale Serve is for sharing content within a private Tailscale network (Tailnet). You'll need to decide how you want to expose the service, the configurations in this repository exposes the local Tailnet.

### Tailscale Funnel

[Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) is a feature that lets you route traffic from the wider internet to a local service running on a machine in your Tailscale network (known as a Tailnet). You can think of this as publicly sharing a local service, like a web app, for anyone to access—even if they don’t have Tailscale themselves.

### Tailscale Serve

[Tailscale Serve](https://tailscale.com/kb/1312/serve) is a feature that lets you route traffic from other devices on your Tailscale network (known as a Tailnet) to a local service running on your device. You can think of this as sharing the service, such as a website, with the rest of your Tailnet.
